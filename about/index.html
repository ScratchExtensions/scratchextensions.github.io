		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>On November 20th, 2017, all Scratch extensions were banned from being advertised from Scratch. This led to many users decide to uninstall them, since they though they were some kind of virus. That's where ScratchExts comes in. This website holds all the Scratch browser extensions. Every extension is reviewed to make sure it's safe. If you would like to submit an extension, head over to the <a href="../submit">submit</a> page to add it.</p>
